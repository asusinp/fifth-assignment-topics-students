# TODO

To complete this fake assignment, **finish up the Device and DeviceManagerImpl classes** as well as the **DeviceType enum** with an eye on _object oriented design principles_ and _best practices_.  

To understand the purpose of every method, please follow the indications in the **Javadoc comments**.

Finally, you will design and code a set of tests on your own for every method.

## REMEMBER

Every test must pass upon delivery and you may add as many tests as you deem necessary. 

### DELIVERY

You may work in teams of **two** or **three** people, but it will be a **personal delivery** due on Sunday the 29th of October 2017.

Happy coding!!!

#### PLEASE NOTE

That this is a fake assignment to properly grasp the explanations while attending class and that the real assignment will follow.
